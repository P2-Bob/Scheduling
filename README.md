# Market Scheduling

Market Scheduling is a JavaScript application built as part of a university project at Aalborg University. Our team developed this project to simplify the complex and demanding task of staff scheduling for hypermarkets. We used Bilka, the largest hypermarket in Denmark, as a case study due to the complexity involved in creating staff schedules.

The application uses JavaScript, particularly the Next.js library and React.js components, to automatically generate schedules while considering various constraints, such as labor laws regarding rest periods, the right to breaks, and youth worker protection; as well as employee preferences and total working hours. The goal is to reduce potential errors that could arise from manually entering schedules and decrease workload.

## Beautiful Design & Cross-Device Compatibility

One of the highlights of this project is its elegant, user-friendly design. The user interface is intuitive, making it easy for users to interact with the application and get the results they need. Moreover, the design is fully responsive and cross-device compatible, ensuring that users can access the application from any device with a browser.

## Getting Started

Before you start using this application, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system as these are necessary to run JavaScript projects. You can then clone the project and install the necessary dependencies using npm:
